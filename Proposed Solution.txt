### Proposed Solution

#### System Design
1. Frontend:  
   - User Interface: A simple webpage with:  
     - Query input box.  
     - Display area for the assistant's responses.  
     - A clean, intuitive design.  
   - Optional API Endpoint: `/ask` POST endpoint to handle programmatic query submissions.  

2. Backend:  
   - Flask Application:  
     - Handles user requests and forwards them to the LLM.  
     - Retrieves knowledge base content for context in query processing.  
   - Knowledge Base:  
     - Stored in a flexible format (JSON/Markdown/TXT).  
     - Supports easy updating through an admin interface.  
   - LLM Integration:  
     - Use OpenAI's GPT models (or alternatives like Azure OpenAI, Hugging Face).  
     - Query pre-processing to structure inputs for optimal LLM performance.  
     - Post-process LLM responses for clarity and context relevance.  

3. Database:  
   - User Interaction Logs:  
     - MongoDB or SQLite to store user queries, responses, and timestamps for analysis.  
   - Knowledge Base Updates:  
     - Track changes to ensure consistency.  

4. Fallback Mechanism:  
   - Provide polite fallback responses (e.g., "Iâ€™m not sure about this. Let me check further.").  
   - Suggest related topics from the knowledge base.  

#### Development Phases  
1. Frontend Creation:  
   - Build the query-response interface using HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript frameworks like React for enhanced interactivity.  

2. Backend Development:  
   - Set up Flask routes for:  
     - Handling user queries (`/ask`).  
     - Admin functionalities (`/admin`).  
   - Integrate the LLM API for dynamic responses.  

3. Database Setup:  
   - MongoDB or SQLite configuration for logging interactions and managing the knowledge base.  

4. Knowledge Base:  
   - Parse structured and unstructured files for loading.  
   - Provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations via the admin interface.  

5. Fallback System:  
   - Define triggers for fallback responses (e.g., insufficient context or low confidence).  
   - Query similarity checks to suggest related topics.  

6. Testing and Documentation:  
   - Thoroughly test for functionality, performance, and edge cases.  
   - Provide user and admin documentation detailing setup, features, and maintenance.


### Key Deliverables
1. Flask Web Application: 
   - Intuitive frontend and optional API for user interaction.  
   - Admin interface for knowledge base updates and log analysis.  

2. Integration with LLM: 
   - Seamless response generation using GPT models.  

3. Knowledge Base Management: 
   - Support for structured/unstructured formats with update capabilities.  

4. Interaction Logs:  
   - Stored user queries and responses for analysis and refinement.  

5. Fallback Mechanism:  
   - Context-aware polite responses and suggestions.  

6. Documentation:  
   - Technical documentation on the architecture, setup, and usage.  
   - User guide for the assistant and admin functionalities.  


### Expected Outcome  
An intelligent FAQ assistant that efficiently answers queries using an LLM, maintains logs for insights, and supports easy updates to its knowledge base, enhancing user experience and operational efficiency.
